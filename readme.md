# Wind Speed Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project aims to predict wind speed using machine learning models, leveraging meteorological datasets from Adrar and Tataouine in Algeria. Accurate wind speed prediction is essential for the optimization and efficiency of wind turbine operations, which are crucial for renewable energy generation.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokmenemelalkia/meteorological-datasets):

- **Adrar Dataset**: Includes meteorological parameters such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, and other relevant factors recorded over time.
- **Tataouine Dataset**: Similarly, this dataset provides detailed meteorological data including wind speed, temperature, humidity, and more.

These datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to ensure they were suitable for building robust machine learning models.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
